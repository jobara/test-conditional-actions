# test-conditional-actions

A small repo for testing conditionally triggered workflows.

The trigger workflow will run on Push and PRs. It can also be triggered manually from the GitHub repo's Action tab. When triggered manually you can have it optionally fail, but from Push and PR events it currently always passes.
